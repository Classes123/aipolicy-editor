# Notes

1. I'm not a C# developer and I'm not going to develop this application further.
2. If you want to develop this application, then I can provide you with access to the repository.
3. If you are the original developer, then I can transfer repository to you.
4.  **New structures may have inaccuracies due to lack of a server where I can test them, as well as their rare use.**
